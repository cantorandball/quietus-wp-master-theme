# Organisation

All CSS comes from these LESS files or [Bower](http://bower.io) libs, all of which are included from `main.less`.

# Editing

For the sake of consistency, try and run [CSSComb](https://github.com/csscomb/csscomb) before commiting changes.

# Helpers etc

The final output is run through [autoprefixer](https://github.com/ai/autoprefixer) and minified with [CSSO](https://github.com/css/csso), so you do not need to use vendor prefixes etc.
