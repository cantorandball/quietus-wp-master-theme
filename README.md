=======================

## Set up
CSS, JS and images are managed by [gulp](http://gulpjs.com) from `/_src`. See the README in `_src` for more info.

_tl;dr_

- _do not save assets outside `/_src`_ â€“ all files in the root-level asset directories (`/css`, `/js`, `/images` etc) will be wiped each time the assets are built.
- you need to install npm & bower packages before working with assets.

## Configuration

For general (non-theme) tQ WP configuration, see [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FCsxd-mHS2J5g_ndOXn0R5J8wVgof9SC_TGE845oSCk/edit?usp=sharing).
